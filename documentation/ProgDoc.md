    - Its purpose was to query the database using PostgreSQL queries to see if the data was extracted and stored correctly.
    - Inherits from DatabaseOperator.
    - **Attributes:**
        - `connection` - An object representing the established connection to the PostgresQL server.
    - **Methods:**
        - **`__Load_query()`**

            - Upon successful execution of the query, prints results.
### 2.6 Main Driver (ParlaStats/main_driver.py)
- The main_driver script takes several command line arguments:
    - `--root` - Name of the corpus root file
        - **default**: `ParCzech.ana.xml`
    - `--root_dir` - Path to the directory, where the corpus source files are stored.
        - **default**: `../ParCzech.TEI.ana`

## 3. Api
- A command line interface between the database and user.
- Implemented in the form of client-server.
- Client and Server communicate with each other using `json` queries and responses.
- For how the json queries should be structured, please see the <a href="https://github.com/ufal/ParlaStats/blob/main/api/example_queries/json_query_Structure.md">query structure</a> documentation.
- The query structure is designed in such a way that it is easy to target multiple databases (multiple corpora) with the same query, eliminating the need to make the same query multiple times for each database.
- Some of them however have to be targeted for singular databases (Queries asking about specific politicians)
### 3.1 Server (Server2_1.py)
- A script implementing the functionality of the server.
- Main purpose is to serve as "middle station" between the client and PostgreSQL database server:
    - **1.** Receive the json query from a client.
    - **2.** Construct the SQL query from the JSON query with respect to predefined join criterions.
    - **3.** Forward the SQL query to the PostgreSQL server.
    - **4.** Get the response(s) from PostgresSQL server.
    - **5.** JSON-ify the response(s) and send them back to client
    - **Note:** If the query targets more databases (corpora) at once, forward it iteratively and return the response in format `[JSON, JSON, ...]`
- #### 3.1.1 TABLE_MATCHING
    - A dictionary describing which tables can be joined to which tables.
    - Predefined table joining to avoid forwarding impossible or simply illogical joins to the PostgreSQL server.

        - **Value:** List of tables that **Key** table can be joined to.
- #### 3.1.2 TABLE_JOINS_CONDITIONS
    - A dictionary describing on which columns should the tables be joined.
    - Again, the idea here is to avoid forwarding wrongly constructed queries to the PostgreSQL server, which also makes writing json queries for users easier as they do not need to know how to join specific tables of the database, this script does it for them instead.
    - Contains key-value pairs where:
        - **Key:** is a tuple of tables in database, specifying tables of the join.
        - **Value:** is a tuple of columns from respective join tables, specifying on which columns should they be joined.
- #### 3.1.3 determine_joins
    - `determine_joins(columns, conditions, group_by)`
    - A function for determining which joins are necessary for a query.
    - Searches for tables mentioned in the queries `columns`, `conditions`, `group_by` sections to find the needed tables, stores them into `required` set.
    - Then forms pairs of the `required` tables to specify joins needed with respect to `TABLE_MATCHING` and `TABLE_JOINS_CONDITIONS`.
    - *parameters:*
        - `columns` - `columns` section of the JSON query. (`[string]`)
        - `conditions` - `conditions` section of the JSON query. (`[{"column":str, "operator":str, "value":str}]`)
        - `group_by` - `group_by` section of the JSON query. (`[string]`)

        - `db_ini_path` - Path to the database connection configuration `.ini` file. (`str`)
    - *returns:*
        - `connection` - Object representing established connection (`psycopg2.connection`) if connecting was successful.
- #### 3.1.5 SQLBuilder
    - `SQLBuilder(json_query)`
    - A function for building SQL queries from JSON queries received from client.
    - Separates the SQL query into 6 sections, builds them separately and finally concatenates them to form a valid SQL query.
        - **1.** `SELECT_CLAUSE` - SELECT \<columns from JSON query concatenated using `", "`> FROM person
        - **2.** `FROM AND JOIN PART`
            - calls the `determine_joins()` function and left joins all tables to `person` table according to the results of `determine_joins()` function.
        - **3.** `CONDITIONS` - Specifies, which tables to select and builds the `WHERE` part of the SQL query from the `conditions` section of the JSON query.
        - **4.** `GROUP BY` - Builds the `GROUP_BY` part of the SQL query from the `group_by` section of the JSON query.
        - **5.** `ORDER BY` - Builds the `ORDER_BY` part of the SQL query from the `order_by` section of the JSON query.
        - **6.** `LIMIT` - Adds a limit to the SQL query specifying how many rows of the response do we want.
    - *parameters:*
        - `json_query` - A structure representing the JSON query received from the client.
    - *returns:*
        - SQL query (`string`)
        - values from conditions (`[string]`)
